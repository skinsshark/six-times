While producing the series “Six Times”, I aimed in hopes of having the viewer understand the pieces in a way that would make them think about their actions and the utilization of time on the planet we inhabit. This piece represents the past, present and the future of our society on Earth. As an aspiring computer engineer and fellow being on this planet, I see technology integrating itself as part of this world. Without technology, it seems that we are incapable of taking care of the world as we have become so advanced. I find we do not have ways to fix the little problems that we have created on the pursuit to the ‘best and most efficient’ life. As a result, we may very well be the sole contributor to our own destruction. However, several opportunities to turn over a new leaf have been presented but there are only two sides to each leaf and only so many leaves out there. My work attempts to use the power of art and aesthetics to intrigue both viewers and myself into further questioning life and the existence of yesterday, today, and tomorrow. 

The first statement to be made would be that each individual has the ability to make a change as nothing is set in stone. Beginning these pieces, my intentions were always to involve human interaction as apposed to a fixed piece that can only be enjoyed from afar. Janet Saad- Cook’s “Sun Drawings” uses the natural medium of sunlight and reflective materials to shine its rays onto a nearby surface. I was enraptured by this and it made me think of how temporary everything is and how easily they can be altered. In addition, it illustrated how nature holds so much beauty in itself. More inspiration came from George Orwell’s “1984”, a nudge to society. In the novel, comes Big Brother, the enigmatic leader in a totalitarian state. Although Orwell heavily exaggerates occurrences, being it is a fictional novel, I can agree with the concept. In my piece, the user is given the controller, providing them with total control and power over the car, representative of society. When “society” is ignored the trailing markers leave a puddle in the paper, destroying the ground beneath it. The marker in the piece signify the past that cannot be erased. They are unexpected at times, but nonetheless beautiful and shapes what is now the present. 

The piece is a tangible replication of my personal view on the world. With the black frame in the form of a cube, the wood is disguised to be of a different material, perhaps metal. It is suggestive that mankind is taking over and wrapping itself around nature. In detail, the cracks in the beams are still wood exposed because it is a process and has not fully consumed the Earth just yet. As well, the frame is not of a round shape to show that the system is not well rounded. The markers attached to the car can be seen as our ecological footprint where supply for the environment decreases as the “controller’s” demands increase. With the clear and frosted sheets of acetate that surround the cube, it is not only for compelling purposes, but as well to resemble a screen. With select sides clear, “society” is given a false hope that there is a chance for complete freedom which seems as though maybe we are the vehicle in the cube, provided a distorted sense of security in a world. I have wondered about the world and been in awe with how everything has just come to exist. If we do not conserve and take care of our reality, it could be gone in the blink of an eye. I am often inspired by novels I read that tinker with the thought of existence. For instance, in “A Wild Sheep Chase”: 
>“Existence ceases for the individuum as we know it, and all becomes chaos. You cease to be a unique entity unto yourself, but exist simple as chaos. And not just the chaos that is you; your chaos is also my chaos. To wit, existence is communication, and communication, existence” (Murakami 179). 

It is interesting to read about everyone together creating an unified chaos, to say that society could be one whole. Communication is the separation between existence and non existence and through art, I find that people communicate their thoughts and creative thinking the best. 

During the process of this piece, before the execution process began, I did not know where to start. There was an endless stream of possibilities but several were to be ruled out due to its unattainability in the provided time frame. Time has been something of great value to me except I often find myself tangled up by it and misusing it all. One of the videos in the viral Youtube series called “Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared” revolved around the concept of time. In the video, there is a line that goes: “If we run out of time, where does it go? Is time even real? Does anyone know?” The puppets start to question the existence of time, perhaps maybe time is just a figment of our imagination? But all that is too creative for the clock so the clock steps in and stops the discussion. The puppets were thinking outside the box but the clock forced them back inside; a box such as the one constructed for this piece. “Eventually everyone runs out of time” closes the video. This can be applied as the “society” vehicle is run by batteries, meaning potentially society could come to an end. 
	My work plays on the possibilities of the viewer in power and a large, geometric piece. It does not go into any further research on how the world began, however it is simply a visual representation of the past, present and future. I enjoy associating my work with entities such as time and the planet because I get the sense that I am part of something bigger than myself.
